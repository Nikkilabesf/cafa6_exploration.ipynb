# 🧬 Protein Function Prediction – CAFA 6 Challenge

**Author:** Tenika Powell  
**Language:** Python 3.11.9  
**Frameworks:** TensorFlow · Keras · NumPy · Pandas · Matplotlib  

---

### 🧠 Project Overview
This project predicts the biological function of proteins based on their amino acid sequences — a task from the **CAFA 6 Kaggle competition**.  
The model uses a multi-class neural network to classify Gene Ontology (GO) terms across the *Molecular Function (F)*, *Biological Process (P)*, and *Cellular Component (C)* aspects.

### ⚙️ Features
- ✅ Sequence data preprocessing from FASTA files  
- ✅ Multi-class label encoding with `LabelEncoder`  
- ✅ Neural network built with TensorFlow / Keras  
- ✅ Accuracy visualization over epochs  
- ✅ Model saving (`.h5` file) for reuse or deployment
